<h1>Desafio React Hamburgueria do Scoob. 游꼢游땖</h1>
<br>
<p>Desafio do m칩dulo de React da Hamburgueria do Scoob foi o meu primeiro contato com a biblioteca React. Estava bastante ansiosa para aprende-l치, pois vejo muitos projetos, estudos e muita atua칞칚o da 
mesma no campo da programa칞칚o. Com ela aprendi a mesclar c칩digos HTML, CSS e JavaScript. Sei que podemos utiliza-l치 com diversas bibliotecas, frameowrks e linguagens. E o bom dessa desafio foi incrementar o Back End, no qual fiz as rotas de Get, Post, Put e Delete, utilizei o Insominia para desenvolver a minha API de pedidos e de clientes. Feito isso, fiz a conex칚o do lado Back e Front.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
